# traffic_light_first_approach
First approach of traffic light project. This part of code simulates the function of car traffic light, yellow blinking traffic light and bicycle traffic light.
As it was difficult to incorporate this code to the architecture of the code that was finally created, this code hasn't been used.
But some parts of it were kept to the new final delivered code.
